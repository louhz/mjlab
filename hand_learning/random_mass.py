# utlize mujoco warp, to generate asset with different mass, and condition the policy on those mass


# also for the geometry


# then generate the manipulated object's trajectory with different mass, geometry, friction and damping setting



# also need tactile for those stuff


# for sim2real the observation of those asset can from tactile and vision
